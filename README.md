# Bayesian Analysis with Python

This is the code repository for [Bayesian Analysis with Python](https://www.packtpub.com/big-data-and-business-intelligence/bayesian-analysis-python?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781785883804), published by Packt. It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the book from start to finish.

**Please follow this [link](https://github.com/aloctavodia/BAP) for an updated version of the code that have been tested to run with the last version of PyMC3.**


## Instructions and Navigations

All of the code is organized into folders. Each folder starts with a number followed by the chapter name.

This book is written for Python version >= 3.5, and it is recommended that you use 
the most recent version of Python 3 that is currently available, although most of the 
code examples may also run for older versions of Python, including Python 2.7 with 
minor adjustments.

Maybe the easiest way to install Python and Python libraries is using Anaconda, 
a scientific computing distribution. You can read more about Anaconda and 
download it [here](https://www.continuum.io/downloads). Once Anaconda is in 
our system, we can install new Python packages with this command: 

```conda install NamePackage```

We will use the following python packages:


* Ipython 5.0
* NumPy 1.11.1
* SciPy 0.18.1
* Pandas  0.18.1
* Matplotlib 1.5.3
* Seaborn 0.7.1
* PyMC3 3.0
